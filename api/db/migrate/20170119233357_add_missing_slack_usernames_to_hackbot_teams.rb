class AddMissingSlackUsernamesToHackbotTeams < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]

  # our Hackbot::Team class in the future.
  #
  # I decided to create a temporary Active Record model instead of writing a
  # custom SQL statement here, because Rails has sane defaults when it comes to
  # iterating through every record in the database.
