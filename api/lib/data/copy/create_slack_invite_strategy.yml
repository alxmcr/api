    This utility will walk you through building a custom Slack invite for your Hack Club.

    When you're done, you'll have a link which you can provide to members and have them join with your configuration.

choose_name: |
  What would you like to name this invite strategy?

  It'll be used in a URL (in the format hackclub.com/slack_invite/NAME_GOES_HERE), so you want to make it short and memorable.

  The default is "<%= name %>".
choose_club_name: What's the name of your club? (default is "<%= club_name %>")
choose_greeting: When your club members join the Slack via your link, I'll send them a custom message. What do you want that message to be? (default is "<%= greeting %>")
should_add_user_group: |
  Would you like to automatically add users who use this invite link to a specific user group?

  Slack has a nice piece of documentation on them here, where you can learn how to make one: https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-User-Groups
add_user_group:
  add: |
    Cool! Can you send me the name of it?

    (eg. If the name of your user group is `@staff`, send a message with the text `@staff`)
  error: I didn't understand that. Please send your Slack usergroup as one message.
  save: Cool! I'm saving that usergroup now. Everyone who goes through your Slack invite link will now be automatically added to it
finish: |
  Awesome! Thanks for configuring your Slack invite link, you can start sending it to members now!

  Here it is: <%= url %>
use_default: |
  OK. Setting the <%= key %> as default value, <%= val %>.
use_custom: |
  Cool! Setting the <%= key %> as <%= val %>.
