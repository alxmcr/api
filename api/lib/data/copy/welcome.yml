welcome: |
    Hey <%= name %>! Noticed you just filled out the intake form â€“ welcome to Hack Club :hackclub:! My name is <%= team.bot_username.titlecase %>, I'm our Slack's friendly robotic helper.

    I can respond to specific commands you give me. For example, if you type `<%= team.bot_mention %> gif pugs`, I'll send you a gif of some adorable dogs. If you want a list of all the things I know how to do, just type `<%= team.bot_mention %> help`.

    I'm pretty basic right now, but I learn new things every week. In fact, if you have any ideas :bulb: for new features talk to <@U0C7B14Q3>!

    If you're the club's point of contact, I'll be reaching out to you every week on Friday to find out the latest information about your club.

    Happy hacking!
