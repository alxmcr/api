        text: Hey! We've been getting feedback that a lot of schools are heading into summer and/or exams right now, and are no longer planning on meeting this school year. Basically, if you're one of these leaders, we'd like to give you a way to opt-out of check-ins. So, are you on a school break right now and not planning on meeting until the next school year?
        actions:
            - text: "Yes! Stop pinging me"
              value: "yes"

              value: "no"
    not_dormant: That's great. Back to the normal flow. Did you have a club meeting this week?
    flavor_text:
        - hope you've had a magnificent week!
        - hope your day's going great!
        - hope you're having an above-average hour!

        - I'm so glad you're here!
        - you're a star ‚òÖÔ∏è!
        - you're looking great today! üëÄ

nps:
    introduction: We just got out of a major funding crisis last semester, so now we have some room to grow as an organization and get better at what we're doing. As part of that it'd be really helpful to know how we've done so far.
    score: Assuming you had a friend at another high school that was technical, how likely is it that you would recommend starting a Hack Club to them? Please answer from 0 to 10, where 0 is not likely at all and 10 is very likely.
    score_confirmation: You picked *<%= score %>*
    invalid: I'm not very smart, so I can only understand numbers like `0` and `10`.
    out_of_bounds: Make sure the number is from 0 to 10.
    improve: What is one way you would improve Hack Club if you had a month, enough money to live, and no other obligations?
    did_well: What is one thing Hack Club did particularly well this past semester?
    completed: Thanks for the info. Now back to our regularly scheduled check-in...

        action_result: "‚úèÔ∏è Keep sending me check-ins! We're still meeting"

resurrection_date:
    unknown: I'm not that smart and couldn't understand that date. Try saying something like "in three months" or "twelve weeks".
    success: Awesome! I'll be in touch a few weeks before then. Please let the Hack Club staff know if you have any questions.

meeting_confirmation:
    question: Did you have a club meeting this week?
    had_meeting:
        action_result: "‚úÖ You had a meeting"
        ask_day_of_week: Okay, sweet! On which day was it? (say something like "monday" or "today" ‚Äì I'm not very clever)
    no_meeting:
        action_result: "‚õîÔ∏è You did not have a meeting"

    on_break: "‚ùÑÔ∏è Your club didn't meet because it's winter break"

no_meeting_reason: Gotcha. Are you planning on having a club meeting in the future?

meeting_in_the_future:

    negative: That's a shame. I'll let the Hack Club team know.
    invalid: I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you :-/. Try saying something like 'yes' or 'no'

day_of_week:
    unknown: "üòî I'm not very smart yet and had trouble understanding you. Try saying something simpler, like \"tuesday\" or \"thursday\"."
    invalid: Hmm, that date didn't happen in the past week (although I may be misunderstanding you). Can you try giving me the day of the week of your meeting again?
    valid: How many people would you estimate came? (I'm not very smart, I'll need you to give me a single number, something like "25" ‚Äì give your best estimate)

    ok: Nice!
    good: <%= count %> is a number to be proud of!
    great: Damn, <%= count %> is a huge number of people!
    awesome: I have no words. <%= count %> people is incredible!
    amazing: I'm speechless. That's incredible.

attendance:
    invalid: I didn't quite understand that. Can you try giving a single number?
    not_realistic:
        negative: I'm going to need a positive number, silly. How many people came to the last meeting?
        too_large: That number is too big for our database! How many people actually came to your last meeting?
    valid: <%= judgement %>

demographics:
    introduction: Hack Club HQ is applying for a grant this week and the Motorola Foundation is asking for demographic info from every club, so I need to ask you a couple follow-up questions. Estimates are OK.
    women: What percentage of your members are women?
    racial_minority: What percentage are a racial minority in the technology industry, defined as not being white or Asian?
    confirm_recorded:
      - Okay, *<%= percent %>%* of your attendees are <%= metric %>.
      - Got it. I've recorded that *<%= percent %>%* of your hackers are <%= metric %>.
      - Gotcha, *<%= percent %>%* of your club's attendees are <%= metric %>.
      - '*<%= percent %>%* of your club members are <%= metric %>.'
      - I'm writing down that *<%= percent %>%* of your club members are <%= metric %>.
    not_percentage: I don't understand that too well. Can you tell me in the format `x%` where x is a number from 0 to 100? For example, `75%`.
    out_of_bounds: <%= percent %>%? Percentages should be from 0 to 100.
    finished: Is there anything the Hack Club team can be helpful with?
