    Imagine me and you, I do
    I think about you day and night, it's only right
    To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
    So happy together
    If I should call you up, invest a dime
    And you say you belong to me and ease my mind
    Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
    So happy together
    I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
    For all my life
    When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
    For all my life
    Me and you and you and me
    No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
    The only one for me is you, and you for me
    So happy together
    I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
    For all my life
    When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
    For all my life
